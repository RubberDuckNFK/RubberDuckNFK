RubberDuckNFK
=============

We are a collective of art hackers, and one guy who we will refer to as "anonymous guy 1" .  It all started with a phone call to anonymous guy 1, who arranged for a camera being oh so graciously allowed in a nearby undisclosed location.  12 hours later, [RubberDuckNfk](http://rubberducknfk.com) materialized.

This project celebrates [Florentijn Hofman's Rubber Duck's visit to  Norfolk, Virginia] (http://duck.chrysler.org) May 17 - 26 outside of the Chrysler Museum of Art.


"The floating 40-footer is quickly approaching icon status after appearances around the world, and it is known for bringing a certain air of whimsy and personal connection that only a supersized bath toy can provide.

There's no wrong way to experience Rubber Duck. Take pictures with the duck or take pictures of the duck. Take a stroll along The Hague with your family and friends to enjoy views best described as just ducky."

... Please hack on this. Submit pull requests. We will do our best to keep [RubberDuckNFK](http://rubberducknfk.com/) updated.
